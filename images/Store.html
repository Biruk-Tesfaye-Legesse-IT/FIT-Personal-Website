I am also a member of students’ charitable organization. We make small but important events for the children at the hospitals in order to raise their mood. I am really proud that I can benefit in such a way for the community I live in.

I am also a member of students’ basketball club. I devote a lot of time to sport. Firstly, I like it as it makes me stronger and healthier. Secondly, I believe that physical activities help to concentrate on the studies themselves as being a sportsman I am not getting tired so quickly and my brain can support more load even during the hectic exam periods.

Unfortunately, I am not a leader by nature. I am rather calm and concentrated person. Though, I can do what I need to do stably and continuously until reaching a certain goal. I always try to concentrate on result. I am good at doing repetitive work that may seem boring for the others. I know my weaknesses and I accept them, but I am trying my best to work on my strengths in order to show myself in the best way for the people.

I plan to apply for master’s scholarship and to go on a traineeship abroad. In future I would like to work for a big multinational company where I hope to build a successful career. “Struggle to achieve the best, with no excuses”, that’s the motto I created for myself and I try to follow it in my everyday life.
